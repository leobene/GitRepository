\titulouk{A visual programming tool for postprocessing of oil reservoir simulations  }

\resumouk{%
This document presents the main concepts of a 
script system of an application focused on the 
postprocessing of oil reservoir simulations
and the proposal and the implementation of a tool
that provides part of the scripts resources to users that are not programmers.
This tool is an property calculator that lets the 
users generate new properties from simple arithmetic
expressions that are developed in an graphic interface that
looks like an ordinary calculator.
This document also presents a brief summary 
of studies about visual programming languages
and the proposal and the beginning of a
simplified visual programming language.
